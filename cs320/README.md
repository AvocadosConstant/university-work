### Course Description
This course offers a comprehensive coverage of computer architecture and the internals of computer systems. You will learn and understand the operations and timing issues of modern microprocessors, memory systems and input/output devices, and the interactions among these components. You will also learn how hardware and software layers – such as the specific algorithm, programming language, compiler, instruction set architecture, and processor implementation – impact program performance. Course projects will involve the design of simulators to measure the performance of key processor features, such as caches and branch predictors.


### Topics
Computer system performance metrics and analysis; instruction set design; CPU organization - datapath and control, single-cycle datapath, multi-cycle datapath, pipelined datapath, out-of-order execution, register renaming, branch handling techniques, supporting precise interrupts in out-of-order pipelines, superscalar processors; memory systems - caches, virtual memory, TLBs, multi-level cache hierarchies, cache subsystem optimizations; input-output systems; storage systems and RAIDs; introduction to multicore and multithreaded processors.
