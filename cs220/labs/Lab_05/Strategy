RPS Strategy

Need to keep track of:
	wins
	frequency of throws
	


Runs recognition:
	If opponent throws multiple of the same in a row, lower chance next throw is the same.

Defend against long runs players (eg. RRRRRRRSSSSSSRRRRRPPPPP)

If they win, they're likely to play the same. So switch to the one that beats them.

If they lose, they're likely to switch to so switch to the one they just threw.

Strategy checking?
	Recognize common strategies and counter.
