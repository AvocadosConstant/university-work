Assignment 3

Execution instructions:

    Code is all located in dev/

    Run "make" to compile all code to the ./driver executable.

    Execute ./driver to run the program.

    Hotkeys:
        
        <SPACE_BAR> Revert to original image
        <b>         Gaussian Blur
        <u>         Unsharp Mask
        <s>         Sobel Operator
        <c>         Convert to HSI
        <d>         Apply Discrete Cosine Transform
        <i>         Apply Inverse Discrete Cosing Transform
        <l>         Detect Lines
        <L>         Detect Circles

DCT and IDCT
    
    Use the hotkey <d> to apply the DCT. It takes about 15 seconds on average on my machine so please be patient.
    Use the hotkey <i> to apply the IDCT. Usually about 20 seconds.

Image Segmentation

    Use <l> and <L> to detect lines and circles. Doesn't work well.
