\begin{homeworkProblem}
    A box contains three marbles â€” one red, one green, and one blue. Consider an
    experiment that consists of taking one marble from the box, then replacing it in the box and drawing a second marble from the box. Describe the sample space.  Repeat for the case in which the second marble is drawn without first replacing the first marble.\\

    \textbf{With replacement}
    \[A = \{RR, RB, RG, BR, BB, BG, GR, GB, GG\}\]

    \textbf{Without replacement}
    \[B = A \setminus \{RR, BB, GG\}\]

\begin{homeworkProblem}[34]
    Prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer found in males. As an indicator of whether a male has prostate cancer, doctors often perform a test that measures the level of the PSA protein (prostate specific antigen) that is produced only by the prostate gland. Although higher PSA levels are indicative of cancer, the test is notoriously unreliable. Indeed, the probability that a noncancerous man will have an elevated PSA level is approximately .135, with this probability increasing to approximately .268 if the man does have cancer. If, based on other factors, a physician is 70 percent certain that a male has prostate cancer, what is the conditional probability that he has the cancer given that

    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item
            the test indicates an elevated PSA level

            Let $P(C) = .7$ be the probability that a male has prostate cancer.

            Let $P(E)$ be the probability that a male has an elevated PSA level.

            \[
                P(C|E) = \frac{P(C\cap E)}{P(E)} 
                = \frac{P(E|C)P(C)}{P(E|C)P(C)+P(E|C^c)P(C^c)}

                = .822..
            \]

        \item
            the test does not indicate an elevated PSA level
            \[
                P(C|E^c) = \frac{P(C\cap E^c)}{P(E^c)} 
                = \frac{P(E^c|C)P(C)}{P(E^c|C)P(C)+P(E^c|C^c)P(C^c)}

    A parallel system functions whenever at least one of its components works.

\begin{homeworkProblem}[42]
    A certain organism possesses a pair of each of 5 different genes (which we will designate by the first 5 letters of the English alphabet). Each gene appears in 2 forms (which we designate by lowercase and capital letters). The capital letter will be assumed to be the dominant gene in the sense that if an organism possesses the gene pair xX, then it will outwardly have the appearance of the X gene. For instance, if X stands for brown eyes and x for blue eyes, then an individual having either gene pair XX or xX will have brown eyes, whereas one having gene pair xx will be blue-eyed. The characteristic appearance of an organism is called its phenotype, whereas its genetic constitution is called its genotype. (Thus 2 organisms with respective genotypes aA, bB, cc, dD, ee and AA, BB, cc, DD, ee would have different genotypes but the same phenotype.) In a mating between 2 organisms each one contributes, at random, one of its gene pairs of each type. The 5 contributions of an organism (one of each of the 5 types) are assumed to be independent and are also independent of the contributions of its mate. In a mating between organisms having genotypes aA, bB, cC, dD, eE, and aa, bB, cc, Dd, ee, what is the probability that the progeny will (1) phenotypically, (2) genotypically resemble
