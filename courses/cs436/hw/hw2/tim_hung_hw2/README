CS 436: Naive Bayes Spam Classifier

Usage:
    Just run in the command line as follows
    
        python3 hw2.py training-set validation-set test-set {yes,no} {yes,no}

Writeup is in /writeup in both .tex and .pdf format.

results.txt is in this directory and has the accuracy without removing stopwords and with removing stopwords.

I had a slight improvement in accuracy after removing stopwords. There was a significant change in my denominator for my calculations after removing stop words (52k to 38k), but there was only a 0.2% improvement in accuracy. I think that is because stop words are used heavily in both spam and ham, so there was not much improvement.



My stemmer code is also in this directory.

Usage:
    Just run in the command line as follows
    
        python3 stemmer.py source_dir out_dir

    The script will stem all the files in the source_dir, and output them to out_dir.
    source_dir must contain a /spam and /ham directory.




I have done this assignment completely on my own. I have not copied it, nor have I given my solution to anyone else. I understand that if I am involved in plagiarism or cheating I will have to sign an official form that I have cheated and that this form will be stored in my official university record. I also understand that I will receive a grade of 0 for the involved assignment for my first offense and that I will receive a grade of “F” for the course for any additional offense.
