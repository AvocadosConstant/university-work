\textbf{Prufer Codes}

    Yo where dat smallest leaf at? Oh there it is, bet. Whatâ€™s it connected to? Oh that one, lemme 
    write that down. Aite now lemme delete that smallest leaf. (repeat until 2 vertices left)\\

\textbf{Kruskal's Algorithm}

    Append each subsequent lowest weighted edge to the spanning tree as long as it doesn't create a cycle. When you hit all vertices, you have constructed the minimum spanning tree.\\

\textbf{Prim's Algorithm}

    Start at a vertex. Construct a minimum spanning tree by appending the minimum weighted edge adjacent to your current minimum spanning tree until all vertices are reached.\\


\textbf{Havel-Hakimi Algorithm}

    Sort in increasing order, remove maximum degree x, decrement x previous degrees by 1, repeat.\\

\textbf{Kirchhoff's Matrix-Tree Theorem}

    For a loopless, connected graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, $V(G)=\{v_1, v_2, ... v_n\}$, $M=(m_{ij})$ an $n \times n$ matrix such that $m_{ii}=d(v_i)$, and $m_{ij}=-(\text{number of edges connecting } v_i $ and $v_j)$, then $\tau(G)=$ the cofactor of any element of M.\\

\textbf{Chromatic Polynomial}

    \[P_G(k) = P_{G-e}(k)-P_{\frac{G}{e}(k)}\]

    For trees: \[P_G(k) = k(k-1)^{n-1}\]
